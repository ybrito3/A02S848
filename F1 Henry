WIRE CENTER CLASSIFICATION (USRO): ELLINGTON EAST-SUBURBAN-281487 
 
THIS PROJECT PROPOSES PLACING /ENERGIZING FIBER AND INSTALLING (1) 864 PFP, EQUIPPED WITH THREE (3) 1X64 SPLITTERS TO DEPLOY XGSPON SERVICES IN PSA 1365PA TO AT 6506 TREBOR ST, PASADENA, TX, IN ROUTE 1 OF THE ELLINGTON EAST WIRE CENTER. 
 
IN MH 10865 [FID: 21115632], SPL EE010,87-96 FROM UG 567F [FID: 21236622] THROUGH 144F STUB [FID 21220494] TO BURIED 24F [FID: 21221129] ADVANCING FIBERS TO FH- 6506T [FID: 21115077]; THEN PLC/SPL FIBER TAIL FROM NEW 864 PFP CAB. SPLICE EE010,87-96 TO THE PROPOSED PFP CABINET 6506 TREBOR ST.  INSTALL ONE (1) NEW 864 CORNING PAD MOUNT PFP CABINET E/W, AND THREE (3) 1X64 SPLITTER(S).  SPLICE EE010,87-96 TO FEEDER PANEL VIA PRETERM TAIL AND TURN UP THREE (3) SPLITTER(S) ON FIBER COUNT EE010,87-89 TO ACTIVATE F1 SPLITTER COUNT: SPT1365PA, 1-192 AND PON COUNT, PON1365PA, 1-864. TEST SPT1365PA, 1-192 AND REMAINING FIBERS EE010,90-96 FROM PFP TO ELLINGTON EAST C.O., MODCD = 845C/AAJUT. 
 
IN THE ELLINGTON EAST CO, ALU/7360 FX-16, ON OLT TID HSTNTXEEOL0010110031, USE EXISTING PON LINE TERMINATION GRANITE OLT LT-08, PORT(S) 13-15 TO ACTIVATE SPLITTER(S) 1-3 FOR SPT1325PA, 1-192 TO PROVIDE XGSPON SERVICES TO THIS PFP @ 6506 TREBOR ST PFP, MOD=AAJUT. 
 
THIS PFP IS APPROXIMATELY 12.288 KF FROM THE ELLINGTON EAST C.O. 
PER XGSPON OPTICAL BUDGET TOOL, PFP QUALIFIES FOR 1X64 SPLITTER. 
CLASS OF XGS-PON OPTICS: N2 
SFCM7: PANNED 
SFCM6: NO   
COSTING FOR THIS PROJECT WAS DONE USING THE NECAT PRICING TOOL
